		<description><![CDATA[Okay so this may be a stupid question, but I have an iphone 3G with software version 3.1.2, I had AT&#038;T but canceled my service so I no longer have an at&#038;t sim that works. I want to use my iphone with my TMobile sim but every tutorial for jailbreaking or unlocking looks like it needs an active internet connection on the iphone which I do not have. Any info would be helpful thanks]]></description>
